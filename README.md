OCaml bindings to the [NVIDIA Management Library](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml)

Build requirements:

* [ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes)
* [obuild](https://github.com/vincenthz/obuild)

Also requires libnvidia-ml.so to be in your dynamic library path at runtime.
